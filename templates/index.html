            <p>Pomofocus is a customizable pomodoro timer that works on desktop & mobile browser.
                 The aim of this app is to help you focus on any task you are working on, 
                 such as study, writing, or coding. This app is inspired by <span class='highlights'>Pomodoro

            <h4> What is Pomodoro Technique?</h4>
            <div class='colored-bor'></div>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo
                 for a more productive way to work and study. The technique 
                 uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally
                  25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval
                   is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', 
                   after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a 
                   university student. <span class='highlights'> - Wikipedia</span>
